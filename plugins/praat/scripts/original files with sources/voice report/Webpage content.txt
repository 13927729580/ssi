the difference with using it in Praat is that in a console application you
cannot use windows. Thus, you cannot call the "Voice report" command that you
see in the Sound window from a console script.

Chapter 6 of the Voice tutorial describes how to do a voice report with only
commands from the Objects window. Such a script runs in the same way from Praat
or from praatcon, because it uses no windows. This is the preferred way of doing
this in a script anyway, because the behavior of the "Voice report" command in
the Sound window depends on the pitch settings and on many other settings. In a
script that uses only Object window commands, all those settings are explicit,
so your results are reproducible.

Here is an example:

form Voice report
text soundFileName
endform
sound = Read from file... 'soundFileName$'
pitch = To Pitch (cc)... 0.01 50 15 no 0.03 0.45 0.01 0.35 0.14 300
plus sound
pulses = To PointProcess (cc)
plus sound
plus pitch
voiceReport$ = Voice report... 0 0 50 300 1.3 1.6 0.03 0.45
reportFileName$ = soundFileName$ - ".wav." + ".txt"
voiceReport$ > 'reportFileName$'

But as stated in the manual, this automatic way takes the whole sound, which is
often not appropriate because there is no measurable vowel at the beginning or
end of the sound file, so this method is reliable only if you select the part of
the sound you are interested in, e.g. by brute force (cutting away the rest) or
by using a TextGrid to annotate the relevant parts.
