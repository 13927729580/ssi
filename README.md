The Social Signal Interpretation (SSI) framework offers tools to record, analyse and recognize human behavior in real-time, such as gestures, mimics, head nods, and emotional speech. Following a patch-based design pipelines are set up from autonomic components and allow the parallel and synchronized processing of sensor data from multiple input devices.
